# Ant Design and Redux Toolkit Template Application

This project was created to allow for quick creation of a new website using the following:

- Create React App
- Ant Design web design framework
- Redux Toolkit (RTK) for global state management
- Typesript
- ESLint, Prettier (Linting, formatting)

## To Begin Using

### The Template is Minimalistic

The intention of this template is for a developer to do the minimum amount of setup required 
to begin working on a new project. It is by no means a finished product. Below is the file structure :



├── public                  # contains meta data
├── src                     # Source files (alternatively `lib` or `app`)
├── package.json            # scripts and project dependencies 
├── tsconfig.json           # typescript rules 
└── README.md
